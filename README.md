# Project Description
A natural language processing classification project designed to predict what programming language is used in Github repos based around breast cancer.

# Project Goal
- Scrape Github for repos with breast cancer as a subject matter sorted by number of stars.
- Find the key word that predict what programming language is used.
- Use NLP techniques to construct 3 machiene learning classification models to predict what programming language is used in the scraped repos.
- Visualize the reults.

# Intial Thoughts


# The Plan
- Acquire data:
    - Scrape Github for repo related breast cancer returning a dataframe with the name of the rep, language used and the readme contentc.

- Prepare data:
    - Cleaning:
        - Encode, decode and lowercase text.
        - Remove punctuation and split text into words.
        - Lemmatize and remove stopwords.

- Explore data:
  - Answer the following initial questions:
 



- Modeling:




# Data Dictionary
| Feature            | Definiton | 
| :---------------- | :------ | 
| Repo      |   The name of the repository  | 
| Language         |  The primary programming language used   | 
| Readme_Contents    |  The contents of the readme(english language text)  | 



# Steps To Reproduce
- Clone the repo
- Use provided link to download the json file and save it in the appropriate path without changing the file name
- Run notebook

Note: If you would like to recreate the Github scraping and API process we used it is n the wrangle file our repo.
